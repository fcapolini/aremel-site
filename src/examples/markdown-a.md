#### Markdown

This example renders a Markdown content.

It uses an optional component included in the Bootstrap Kit. Once imported, it automatically adds the [Showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) library to the output page.

The server-side variant is included in Aremel server. This way the output page already includes the rendered content and can be indexed by search engines.
