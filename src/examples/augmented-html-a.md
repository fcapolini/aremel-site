#### Augmented HTML

Aremel is a modern web framework, based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), that addsÂ support for **reusability**, **reactivity**, and **isomorphism** to plain HTML.

As a language, it can be thought of as the opposite of [React's JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html): rather than adding markup support to a reactive framework, it adds reactivity to HTML itself.
