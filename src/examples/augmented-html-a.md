#### Augmented HTML

Aremel is a modern web framework, based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev)/[Express](http://expressjs.com) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), that augments HTML adding support for **reusability**, **reactivity**, and **isomorphism**.

As a language, it can be thought of as the opposite of [React's JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html): rather than adding markup support to a reactive framework, it adds reactivity to HTML itself.

**Logic attributes**, prefixed with `:`, can be used to add values and functions to any tag.

**Expressions** can reference logic attributes and can be placed anywhere in text and attributes, surrounded by `[[` and `]]`.
