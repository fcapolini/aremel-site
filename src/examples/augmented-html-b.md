#### Concepts

The Aremel server includes:

* **A preprocessor** with support for *source inclusion* and *macro processing*.

* **A compiler** that generates page-specific reactive JavaScript code.

* **A server-side DOM** where page logic is performed before delivery.

In delivered pages:

* **Logic attributes** are removed and turned into page-specific code.

* **Expressions** are replaced with their result and, again, are added to page code.
