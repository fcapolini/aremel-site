#### Bootstrap Kit

This example uses Aremel's [Bootstrap Kit](https://github.com/fcapolini/aremel-bootstrap-kit).

By importing the kit in the `<head>` tag, all needed resources are automatically included.

The kit defines a set of custom tags that implement Bootstrap components and hide all relevant [details](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/accordion/#example).
